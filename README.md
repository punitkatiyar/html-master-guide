# HTML Master Guide 

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design webpages. It structures web content using tags and elements**


## Key Features of HTML:

✅ Markup Language – It structures content using tags .

✅ Not a Programming Language – It doesn’t have logic like JavaScript; it just organizes content.

✅ Works with CSS & JavaScript – CSS styles the page, and JavaScript makes it interactive.

✅ Platform-Independent – Works on all browsers and devices.

## HTML Tag

An HTML tag is a piece of code used to define the structure and content of a webpage in HyperText Markup Language (HTML). Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>) and usually come in pairs:

- An opening tag (e.g., < p >)

- A closing tag (e.g., < /p >)

## HTML Element

**Elements are the building blocks of web pages. They define the structure and content of a webpage**

- An opening tag

- The content inside the tag (if applicable)

- A closing tag (if required)

## HTML5 structure or Template
