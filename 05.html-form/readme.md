# HTML Form Tag And Attribute

- **Name  :** Specifies the name of the input field. The name is used to identify the input field when the form is submitted.

- **Value :** Sets the initial value of the input field. This attribute is used to pre-fill the input with a default value.

- **Placeholder :**  Provides a hint or example text that is displayed in the input field before the user enters any value.

- **Required :** Specifies that the input field is required and must be filled in before the form can be submitted.
